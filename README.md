## Usage
This addon assumes that your materials have a valid lego color name, such as `SOLID-BLACK`. They may contain a dot and anything after them such as `SOLID-BLACK.001`. To make your materials look like Lego, right click on your object in Object mode, and then select "Assign Lego Materials" from the object context menu.
